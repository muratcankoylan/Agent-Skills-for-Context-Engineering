## Workshop Facilitation Guide

### Pre-Workshop (30 minutes)

1. **Choose persona** — Which customer type are we mapping?
2. **Define scenario** — What specific goal or use case?
3. **Invite stakeholders** — Product, design, marketing, support
4. **Prepare materials** — Whiteboard, sticky notes, or Miro board

### Workshop Agenda (2-3 hours)

**Part 1: Setup (15 minutes)**

- Introduce the persona and scenario
- Explain the journey map structure
- Set ground rules (all perspectives welcome, no solutions yet)

**Part 2: Map the Stages (60 minutes)**

- Identify 5-7 stages in the journey
- For each stage, capture:
  - Actions (what they do)
  - Thoughts (what they think)
  - Emotions (how they feel)
  - Pain points (what frustrates them)

**Part 3: Identify Opportunities (30 minutes)**

- Review the full journey
- Highlight moments of delight and friction
- Brainstorm opportunities for improvement

**Part 4: Prioritize (30 minutes)**

- Score opportunities by impact and effort
- Agree on top 3 priorities
- Assign owners and next steps

### Facilitation Tips

1. **Start with empathy** — "Put yourself in the customer's shoes"
2. **Use real quotes** — Reference actual customer feedback
3. **Encourage debate** — Different perspectives are valuable
4. **Focus on problems first** — Don't jump to solutions
5. **Make it visual** — Use colors, emojis, drawings
6. **Document everything** — Capture all ideas, even if not prioritized

## Integration Points

- **`proto-persona`**: Persona is the subject of the journey map
- **`/solo:build discover`**: Journey maps inform discovery insights
- **`problem-statement`**: Pain points become problem statements
- **`prd-development`**: Opportunities become feature ideas

## Key References

- **`references/journey-mapping-guide.md`**: Complete workshop facilitation script
- **`references/journey-map-template.md`**: Blank template for mapping
- **`references/examples.md`**: 3 example journey maps (B2B SaaS, Service, E-commerce)

## Tips

1. **Focus on one persona** — Don't try to map multiple personas at once
2. **Be specific** — "Googles 'CRM for freelancers'" not "Searches online"
3. **Include emotions** — Use emojis (😊😐😟) to visualize emotional journey
4. **Validate with users** — Show the map to real customers and ask "Is this accurate?"
5. **Update regularly** — Journey maps should evolve as your product changes
6. **Prioritize ruthlessly** — You can't fix everything. Focus on highest-impact opportunities.
